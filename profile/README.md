## What is a Climate Little Picture?
A Climate Little Picture (CLIP) is a means of communicating climate data in a human readable form.

They are defined as being:

#### Data-driven
- A picture rendered through frameworks, tools and technologies – such as D3.js, Tableau, ObservableHQ and Datawrapper – for the instant and dynamic visualisation of an underlying climate data layer

#### Design-first
- A picture built on the principle that its aesthetic design drives its engineering direction. The design language defined and adhered to, draws from principles in industrial design, product design, and cognitive science

#### Self-contained
- A picture embeddable in, and loosely coupled to, other pictures, stories and systems

#### Rapidly-buildable
- A picture rapidly creatable from inception of idea to its rendering

#### Rapidly-deployable
- A picture rapidly deployable to its target environment once built
